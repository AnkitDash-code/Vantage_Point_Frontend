**Kay/O** flashes to deny aggressive pushes |\n\n### **Attack Formation**  \n\n- **Spread:** **3‑1‑1** (1 Duelist, 2 Initiators, 1 Controller, 1 Sentinel)  \n- **Entry Order**  \n  1. **Raze** → first‑wave entry (Blast Pack → wall‑bang).  \n  2. **Sova** → Recon Bolt on the site, tag enemies.  \n  3. **Kay/O** → flash‑combo (Stun + Flash) on tagged spots.  \n  4. **Viper** → Toxic Screen / Poison Cloud to block sightlines.  \n  5. **Cypher** → lurk on opposite flank, set up trap for rotating defenders.  \n\n- **Lurk Tendency:** **Cypher** acts as the dedicated lurker, often rotating from A‑site to B‑site or mid after planting.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Utility Sequences  \n\n### **A‑Site Execute**  \n1. **Sova** fires Recon Bolt onto A‑Main → tags defenders.  \n2. **Kay/O** flashes the tagged area (Stun + Flash).  \n3. **Viper** drops a Toxic Screen across A‑Heaven, then a Poison Cloud on A‑Back.  \n4. **Raze** uses Blast Pack to clear the corner, then fires a Paint Shell into the plant spot.  \n5. **Cypher** drops a trap on A‑Heaven to catch any post‑plant retake.\n\n### **B‑Site Execute**  \n1. **Kay/O** smokes B‑Long & B‑Back simultaneously.  \n2. **Viper** casts a wall through the smoke to block sightlines.  \n3. **Sova** recon‑bolts B‑Main, tagging any defender.  \n4. **Raze** flashes the tagged spot, then detonates a Paint Shell into the plant zone.  \n5. **Cypher** places a camera on B‑Back and a trap on B‑Long for post‑plant information.\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Agent Synergies  \n\n- **Recon + Flash Combo:** *Sova → Kay/O* – Sova’s tag guarantees Kay/O’s flash lands on a visible enemy.  \n- **Wall + Poison:** *Viper → Kay/O* – Viper’s Toxic Screen blocks vision while Kay/O’s flash forces enemies out of cover.  \n- **Blast + Trap:** *Raze → Cypher* – Raze clears a corner; Cypher’s trap punishes any defender who tries to re‑enter.  \n- **Smoke + Lockdown (if using Killjoy):** *Kay/O smoke → Killjoy Lockdown* – Smoke forces enemies into the lockdown radius for a guaranteed 5‑second hold.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Role Balance Analysis  \n\n- **Initiator 40 %**, **Controller 25 %**, **Duelist 20 %**, **Sentinel 15 %**  \n- **Classification:** **Balanced‑Aggressive** – heavy on intel and entry, moderate on site control, light on pure dueling.  \n\n**Implications**  \n- **Strengths** – Early‑round information dominance (Sova/Kay/O), strong site denial (Viper), flexible post‑plant setups (Cypher).  \n- **Weaknesses** – Limited pure duelist firepower; may struggle against teams with two high‑damage duelists (e.g., Jett + Reyna).  \n- **Strategic Advice** –  \n  - Prioritize **early recon** on every round to compensate for lower duelist damage.  \n  - Use **Viper’s wall** to create “soft‑A” or “soft‑B” zones, forcing opponents to play around it.  \n  - Rotate **Cypher** as a secondary lurker on maps with long flanks (Icebox, Bind).  \n\n---  \n\n**Action Items for Upcoming Scrims**  \n\n- Run **Bind** practice with the Primary Comp; focus on synchronized Sova‑Kay/O flashes.  \n- Test **Killjoy** swap on **Icebox** to see if the added lockdown lifts DEF WR above 35 %.  \n- Record **mid‑control recon success rate**; aim for >70 % tag‑to‑flash conversion.  \n\nGood luck, EG! 🎮",

**Blast Pack** (Raze) to destroy Arrow Launcher | **A‑site “Heaven”** – hold mid‑upper boxes; **B‑site “Back‑site”** – stay behind cover to avoid early scans |\n| KAY/O | **Sage** | **Barrier Orb** to block Suppression Grenade line‑of‑sight; **Resurrection** to offset forced‑kill utility | **A‑site “A‑Main”** – keep a wall between KAY/O and plant; **B‑site “B‑Long”** – use pillars to break line of sight |\n| Viper | **Reyna** | **Dismiss** to evade Toxic Screen & Poison Cloud; **Leer** (if Reyna‑style) to blind Viper’s line of sight | **A‑site “A‑Heaven”** – stay out of Viper’s wall‑range; **B‑site “B‑Back”** – use vertical angles to avoid poison spill |\n| Raze | **Sage** (or **Killjoy**) | **Slow Orb** to limit Blast Pack bounce; **Turret** (Killjoy) to punish Raze’s entry | **A‑site “A‑Ramp”** – keep distance from Raze’s explosive radius; **B‑site “B‑Garage”** – use tight corners to force her to waste explosives |\n| Cypher | **Jett** | **Updraft** to bypass Trapwire & Cyber Cage; **Tailwind** to dodge Spycam placement | **A‑site “A‑Mid”** – stay out of Cypher’s line of sight; **B‑site “B‑Back”** – use moving angles to deny static traps |\n\n### Sova Counter Protocol\n- **Early‑mid aggression:** Jett pushes mid at 0:05 – 0:07 s, using Tailwind to dodge the Recon Bolt.\n- **Utility denial:** Deploy a **smoke** (if on your side) at the expected Arrow Launcher landing zone; Jett’s Updraft can clear the bolt after it lands.\n- **Post‑plant:** Raze’s Blast Pack can destroy Sova’s Recon Drone if it lingers near the spike.\n\n### KAY/O Counter Protocol\n- **Suppression block:** Sage places a **Barrier Orb** at the choke (A‑Main or B‑Long) before KAY/O can fire his Suppression Grenade.\n- **Force‑buy trap:** If the enemy is on a bad economy (< 4000 cr), force‑buy a **Sage wall** to force a retake, exploiting their 50 % eco win rate.\n- **Ultimate steal:** When KAY/O ultimates, use **Sage’s Resurrection** on a teammate who survived the suppression to swing the round.\n\n### Viper Counter Protocol\n- **Screen dodge:** Reyna’s **Dismiss** at 0:03 s after Viper fires Toxic Screen prevents vision loss.\n- **Wall breach:** Use **Jett’s Updraft** to jump over Viper’s Poison Cloud, then flank from Heaven.\n- **Plant timing:** Force Viper to waste her **Snake Bite** on a decoy (Sage’s Orb) before the plant, leaving her without post‑plant damage.\n\n### Raze Counter Protocol\n- **Explosive waste:** Sage’s **Slow Orb** placed at the expected Blast Pack landing spot forces Raze to waste her **Paint Shells**.\n- **Trap placement:** Killjoy’s **Turret** on A‑Ramp watches for Raze’s entry; a single shot forces her to retreat.\n- **Eco‑round pressure:** On forced buys, push aggressively with **Jett** to force Raze into a 1‑v‑3 scenario; her 12.5 % win rate on eco rounds drops below 30 %.\n\n### Cypher Counter Protocol\n- **Trap avoidance:** Jett’s **Updraft** clears Cypher’s **Trapwire** and **Cyber Cage** from high ground.\n- **Spycam denial:** Use **Sage’s Barrier** to block line of sight to Cypher’s **Spycam**; the camera cannot see through walls.\n- **Late‑round aggression:** When Cypher’s utility is on cooldown (average 35.2 % trade efficiency), execute a fast A‑site take with **Raze** and **Jett**.\n\n---\n\n## Map Control Denial  \n\n- **A‑site focus (62.5 % bias):**  \n  - Deploy **smokes** at **A‑Heaven** and **A‑Main** at 0:04 s to block their early recon.  \n  - **Jett** or **Raze** can **entry‑frag** the smoke at 0:07 s, forcing a 2‑v‑2 trade.  \n\n- **B‑site fallback:**  \n  - Hold **B‑Long** with a **Sage wall** at 0:06 s; forces the enemy to rotate through **B‑Back** where you have vertical advantage.  \n\n- **Timing windows:**  \n  - **0:00 – 0:05 s:** Plant early utility (smokes, walls) to deny recon.  \n  - **0:10 – 0:15 s:** Push with **Jett**/ **Raze** to capitalize on any missed recon.  \n\n---\n\n## Economic Warfare  \n\n- **Anti‑eco protocol (50 % eco win):**  \n  - **Force‑buy** a **Sage wall** or **Jett Updraft** when the enemy is under 4000 cr; the wall forces a retake and reduces their eco success to < 30 %.  \n  - **Eco‑round bait:** Let a single defender hold a site with a **smoke**; when the enemy rushes, rotate **Raze** and **Jett** to flank, turning their cheap push into a loss.  \n\n- **Bonus round denial:**  \n  - On **force‑buy** rounds, **save** a **Reyna dismiss** or **Jett Tailwind** to escape a potential 1‑v‑1; this preserves your economy while denying their kill‑potential.  \n\n---\n\n## Setup Breakers  \n\n- **Default defense break:**  \n  - **Mid control** at 0:03 s with **Jett** (updraft) or **Sage** (wall) to contest the central choke, forcing them into a **rush** pattern (< 40 s).  \n  - Follow with **Raze** or **KAY/O** to clear any planted utility.  \n\n- **Utility counter‑stack:**  \n  - **Stack early smokes** on the side they favor (A‑site) and **rotate late** (after 0:12 s) to catch them off‑guard when they commit to a site.  \n  - Use **Killjoy’s Alarmbot** on the opposite site to punish their rotation, creating a **double‑site pressure**.  \n\n- **Site‑hold disruption:**  \n  - **Viper’s Toxic Screen** can be nullified by **Reyna’s Dismiss** or **Jett’s Tailwind**; immediately follow with a **spike plant** to force a post‑plant retake while they are disoriented.  \n\n> **Bottom line:** Hit Edward Gaming early, deny their recon (Sova, Cypher), block their suppressors (KAY/O), and exploit their 50 % eco win rate with forced‑buy walls and aggressive flank pushes. Keep the pressure on A‑site, rotate quickly, and use high‑mobility agents to out‑maneuver their static utility.",

force them to over‑extend | • **Two‑man B‑stack** with **utility** (smokes, molotov) to punish forced buys <br>• **Save** if pistol lost – force 2‑round eco | **Haodong** (weak link) |\n| **4‑5 – Full‑Buy** | 36.5 % win (full) | • **B‑site early execute** on maps where they favor A (Icebox, Sunset) <br>• Use **Corrode** (if available) to block their mid‑push <br>• **Stack utility** on their preferred site to force a retake | • **A‑site hold** with **vertical angles** (Jett, Reyna) <br>• **Rotate** on 2‑second cue (smoke drop) | **ZmjjKK** |\n| **6+ – Late Game** | Mixed | • **Force 5v4** by trading picks; **no solo plays** <br>• **Clamp** Haodong on rotations, deny clutch opportunities | • **Play for picks**; keep **controller alive** for smokes <br>• **Eco‑round safety** – hold angles, don’t over‑commit | **Haodong** (clutch danger) |\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Critical IF/THEN Decision Tree  \n\n- **Opening Duel**  \n  - **IF** we secure **first blood** → **Play aggressive 5v4**; push the site they just lost and force a quick plant.  \n  - **IF** we lose first blood → **Reset** to a 4v5 posture, hold angles, and look for a **trade** before committing.  \n\n- **Man‑Advantage**  \n  - **5v4** → **Fast push** with two entry fraggers; isolate the isolated opponent (usually Haodong).  \n  - **4v5** → **Delay** 2‑3 s, use **smokes** to block sight, then **retake** if they plant.  \n\n- **Utility Loss**  \n  - **IF** our **controller dies first** → **Abort** the execute, fall back to **mid‑control** and force a pick.  \n  - **IF** EG loses a **smoke** → **Press** mid‑control immediately; they’ll be blind on the next site.  \n\n- **Economy Triggers**  \n  - **IF** EG is on **eco** (≤ 4000) → **Play long‑range**; avoid hero plays, force them to **force‑buy** on the next round.  \n  - **IF** we are **out‑gunned** (full‑buy vs eco) → **Play disciplined** – hold angles, trade picks, never over‑extend.  \n\n- **Ultimate Usage**  \n  - **IF** an EG player dies **with ultimate ready** → **Exploit** the gap; plant or retake without contest.  \n  - **IF** we have an unused ultimate on a **lost round** → **Save** for the next round; do not gamble on a low‑probability clutch.  \n\n---\n\n## 👤 Player Assignments  \n\n### 📊 Key Player Data  \n\n| Player | Role | Win Rate | Duels | KD | Clutch (W/L) |\n|--------|------|----------|-------|----|--------------|\n| **ZmjjKK** | Duelist | **63.0 %** | 46 | 1.28 | 2/9 |\n| **Haodong** | Controller | 48.5 % | 28 | **0.72** | **4/11** (36.4 %) |\n| **Other EG** | — | — | — | — | — |\n\n### HUNT PROTOCOL – ZmjjKK  \n- **Assignee:** **Our Ace Fragger (Jett)** + **Support (Sova)**  \n- **Utility:** Deploy **smoke + recon bolt** on his typical entry (A‑mid on Icebox, B‑garage on Bind).  \n- **Goal:** Force a **pre‑plant duel**; deny his first‑blood advantage.  \n\n### EXPLOIT PROTOCOL – Haodong  \n- **Assignee:** **Two‑man flank (Raze + Phoenix)**  \n- **Tactics:**  \n  - **Isolate** him on rotations (B‑to‑A on Sunset, A‑to‑B on Icebox).  \n  - **Force 1v1** with **close‑range weapons**; exploit his low KD.  \n- **Utility:** **Molotov/Incendiary** to block his sightlines; **flash** on entry.  \n\n### AVOID PROTOCOL – Haodong (Clutch)  \n- **Never** give a solo 1v1 after plant.  \n- **Always** have **at least two teammates** covering post‑plant angles.  \n- **Double‑peek** with **Sage** wall to deny his line of sight.  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timing Protocols  \n\n- **0‑30 s (Opening)**  \n  - **Mid‑control** with **Sova** recon; place **smokes** on chokepoints.  \n  - **If** EG pushes A early → **Stack** B, force them into a **slow default**.  \n\n- **30‑60 s (Mid‑Round)**  \n  - **Watch** for **Corrode** or **smoke** drops – cue rotation.  \n  - **If** EG holds a **utility trade** → **Delay** 2‑3 s, then **counter‑smoke** and retake.  \n\n- **60 s+ (Late)**  \n  - **If** plant on A → **Two‑man post‑plant** (Sage wall + Jett vertical).  \n  - **If** plant on B → **Clamp** Haodong with **flank**; **no solo clutch**.  \n\n---\n\n## 💰 Economy Warfare  \n\n- **When EG is Eco (≤ 4000)**  \n  - **Play long‑range** (Operator, Marshal).  \n  - **Force** them to **force‑buy** on the next round; punish with **utility‑heavy** executes.  \n\n- **When WE are Out‑gunned (EG full‑buy, us eco)**  \n  - **Hold angles**, **trade** picks, **avoid hero plays**.  \n  - **Save** credits for a **full‑buy on round 4**; aim for a **5‑round win streak**.  \n\n- **Full‑Buy Counter**  \n  - **EG win rate 36.5 %** → **Aggressive utility trade** (smokes + molotov) to **break their execution**.  \n\n---\n\n## 🗺️ Map‑Specific Notes & Site Priorities  \n\n| Map | EG WR | Attack % | Defense % | OUR Focus |\n|-----|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Icebox** | 41.7 % | 60 % | 28.6 % | **A‑site split**; force B‑rotate, dominate mid‑vertical angles |\n| **Sunset** | 29.7 % | 38.1 % | 18.8 % | **B‑site early exec**; use **Corrode** to block A‑mid |\n| **Split** | 45.0 % | 31.2 % | 54.2 % | **Hold B**; pressure A‑mid, force slow defaults |\n| **Breeze** | 31.6 % | 71.4 % | 8.3 % | **Avoid** – EG excels on long sightlines; **veto** if possible |\n| **Bind** | 59.1 % | 50 % | 66.7 % | **A‑site stack**; exploit teleport‑rotation, **delay** rushes with smokes |\n\n- **Veto Priority:** **Breeze** (EG strongest) and **Sunset** (low overall WR).  \n- **Pick‑Map Preference:** **Icebox** and **Bind** – we have strong vertical control and can punish their site bias (62.5 % A‑site).  \n\n---\n\n## 📌 Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet  \n\n- **First Blood → Aggressive 5v4**  \n- **Controller dies → Abort exec**  \n- **Haodong clutch → Double‑peek, never solo**  \n- **Eco round → Long‑range, force‑buy**  \n- **Full‑Buy → Utility trade, press mid**  \n\nStay disciplined, keep the economy on our side, and lock down **ZmjjKK** early. Victory comes from choking EG’s clutch engine and exploiting their predictable site bias. Good luck, team!"
